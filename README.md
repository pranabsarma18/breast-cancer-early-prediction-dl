# breast-cancer-early-prediction
In this Project using Deep Learning we predict the early instances of Breast Cancer. We have used pre-trained VGG16 CNN model to classify the breast cancer instances in three different classes: Benign, Malignant and Normal. I have added all the necesserry files in the respective folders. The dataset used for the project can be requested to me and I will be happy to share. Please rate me a star if you like my work and if it is helpful to your project/ research
